  ================================================================

ABOUT

This document provides a brief description of the samples included
in the PLX SDK. Please refer to the source code in each sample &
the PLX SDK User's Manual for additional details.

The PLX samples are intended to demonstrate use of the PLX API. The
samples are not intended for debug or real world applications, although
they can be extended to complex applications. They should be treated
as a reference for writing custom software that utilizes the PLX API.

Not all samples work with all PLX devices. The PLX API supports numerous
PLX chip families in PCI/PCIe, including 6000-series PCI-to-PCI bridges,
9000-series PCI-to-Local bus bridges, 8000-series PCI/PCIe bridges &
switches, PEX88000 PCIe Switches, & PEX89000 PCIe Switches.
Some samples are provided only for specific chip families.


SAMPLES

- ApiTest
Simple application that calls various PLX APIs for a selected device
& verifies return codes & parameters.  The API calls made depend upon
the type of device selected.

- DSlave
Demonstrates how to read/write from a PLX 9000 PCI BAR space using the
PLX API/driver to perform the data transfer. This operation is often
referred to as "Direct Slave".

- DSlave_BypassApi
Similar to the 'DSlave' sample, except this sample uses the PLX API only
to map a PCI BAR space directly to the application's virtual space. The
application can then directly access the space via simple memory dereferencing,
bypassing the PLX API/driver & resulting in greater performance, especially
for small transfers.  The application is responsible for initializing the
BAR space, such as setup of translation/remap registers.

- LocalToPciInt [9000-series & 8311]
Demonstrates how to wait for a generic Local-to-PCI interrupt using the
PLX Notification API.

- NT_DmaTest [8000-series switches with DMA & NT support]
Demonstrates using the DMA engine in a PLX 8000 switch to transfer data through
a PLX 8000 NT port.

- NT_DmaTest [8000-series switches with DMA & NT support]
Demonstrates using the DMA engine in a PLX 8000 switch to transfer data through
a PLX 8000 NT port.

- NT_LinkTest [8000-series switches with NT support]
Demonstrates NT communication by sending random sized data buffers through a
PLX 8000 NT port.

- NT_Sample [8000-series switches with NT support]
Demonstrates very basic NT communication by sending keystrokes from one system
through a PLX 8000 NT port & displaying them on the other system.

- PerfMonitor [PEX88000, PEX89000 & PLX 8000-series switches with Performance Counter support]
Demonstrates use of the PLX Performance API to capture & display performance
measurements from the chip. Note PerfMonitor does not support Synthetic mode of
operation of PEX88000 & PEX89000 switches.

- PlxCm
The PLX Command-Line Monitor useful for debugging. Complete source is provided.

- PlxDma [9000 & 8000 series devices with DMA support]
Demonstrates block & SGL DMA using the PLX DMA API.

- PlxDmaPerf [8000-series devices with DMA support]
Demonstrates continuous block DMA & calculates performance measurements.

- PlxDmaSglNoApi [9000 & 8000-series devices with DMA support]
Demonstrates DMA using manual setup of SGL descriptors. This is useful when an
application has a list of specific DMA transfers to perform.

- PlxEep
A PLX command-line utility for reading/writing EEPROMs connected to PLX devices.
Useful for production-line type environments.

- PlxNotification
Demonstrates use of the PLX Notification API to wait for interrupt events.

- SampleAppGUI
A very simple GUI provided only to demonstrate using the PLX API in a GUI app
instead of a console type application.

- SerdesEyeTest
Code taken from the PLX PDE tool to show how to measure serdes eye data. This code
is only sample source for reference purposes & not an actual running application.

- Shared
Some common functions shared by all sample application to perform tasks such as
device selection, error display, etc.
